## Getting Started

Clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser:

## bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/endless-ocean.git
cd endless-ocean
open index.html  # or just double-click it

## How It Works

 Waves are drawn using a sine function across the canvas.

 Clouds are rendered as overlapping circles and move horizontally with variable speeds.

 The animation loop updates both elements smoothly using requestAnimationFrame.
